A simple realization of the follow paper
https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.47.8.1113.10226
the part of a fast recursive search algorithm for the max-npv problem has been completed and find that the result of the example of the paper is wrong
but the part of branch-and-bound algorithm still has some problem so that it can not caculate the example of the paper
